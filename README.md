Reactive Website


So before we dive in to this - I know it's a mess of "divs" and very little refactoring.  I'll be spending a nice chunk of my day refactoring this monday 6/22.  I spent most of my time trying to understand why anything I tried to put under my carousel was instead floating over it (many hairs were pulled), and I finally, like only a half hour before I submitted, realized that I was missing a </div> closing out the carousel.  

The lesson learned was the value of html validation services, because that's how I found the error.

Now that I know what's going on, after I refactor a bit tomorrow, I'll be adding in a section which talks about my travels throughout the country and some of my favorite things to do, which I tried to do at first, but it kept floating over the carousel, for like 3 days. 

I'm also realizing I need a 1 on 1 with a tutor. So I'm sending Jen and email.  Back when I went to university, I had the very stupid mindset of "I don't need a tutor, I'm doing just fine in my class." Even if I "understand" the material, I think it's definitely a good to work with someone 1 on 1.
